# SQLi Scanner

So this is my project of creating an SQLi scanner. this code uses beautifulsoup to web scrap a website , search for forms and try entering a sample text, If the website is secured from SQLi attacks, then it will give a list of standard outputs, else it will provide some other error code which can be evaluted as a vulnerability.It is a basic form of my code which I would like to develop further.
